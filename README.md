# I Did

## About

When I do stuff, I like to remember it.

When I want to remember stuff, I use `i did`.

## Install

Put `i` some place in your path.  I like `$HOME/bin`, but do what you like.

## Use

    $ i "did a bunch of stuff"
    Yeah you did!

    $ i did
    >> did a bunch of stuff

    $ pbpaste
    did a bunch of stuff

    $ i "did some more stuff"
    Yeah you did!

    $ i did
    >> did a bunch of stuff, did some more stuff

    $ pbpaste
    did a bunch of stuff, did some more stuff
